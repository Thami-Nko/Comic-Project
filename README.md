# Comic-Project
This project contains instructions on a program that needs to be created. 

The program needs to be able to take input from a user, indicating a comic name and volume number in the form:
'comic name volume number' e.g 'attack on titan 177'

The program must then use the manga name and volume number to download all the comic pages from the website https://readms.net
The program must save all the comics pages in a directory name using the manga name.
